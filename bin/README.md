aFetish4Systems
===============
November 19th, 2013 (MVCA)
As of today(), I've yet to initiate any code for my newest project, except for the obligatory proclamation, which presently() lacks any content worth noting and when 'committed' will certainly be ridiculed by all of my lovers(current, past, present),-- such is business in the Open-source lottery.

Start.001
From a mathematical perspective, my initial commit will consist of the following code (errors notwithstanding):

// need to create a value for a Fetim (1 unit of Fetish)
{Variable(system).Fetish = k; k = count(system.fetish); Variable(unit).Fetim = 1/k; Variable(therefore).start.001 = Fetim/Fetish;}

myFetim.001 (if children are near, close their ears)
I am but one Fetim within the Fetish known as the GoldenGateBridgeEnthusiasts (or GGBE).

As a member of the Fetish GGBE, a Fetim is required: to visit the Golden Gate Bridge at least once within his/her lifetime, and during said visit, the Fetim is to take myriad photos of this, that and of him or her; all the while, the Fetim will be standing upon the bridge's wearied deck contemplating either the answer to a certain proposal or the distance to the water below. 

"I don't know how to ask, but have you ever seen somebody ..." somebody once asked me.
Within the context of my fetim (I've been on the bridge and I've contemplated the questions), I understood Somebody's question, but I was at a loss for her intentions and thus answered as truthfully as I could.

"Nope." Then my mind went off and tried to recall if my answer were indeed 'true' and if not, what exactly can I do to help.

The Axiom of Desperate Math: a suicide barrier is not the answer to my question
According to google CrackPipe, since the beginning of time, on average each year, ~21 people have taken the 'leap' and failed to return,-- the math here would suggest that Somebody (on average) jumps from the bridge every 17 days or so.

Somebody once told me that I was 'good' at math (2+2 = 5) but, I am at a loss when I try to understand how a suicide occurs every 17 days on the Bridge [do you know how many proposals are occurring?]

Which, of course, makes me wonder, "Are these events really occurring? and, if so, what exactly can I do to help out."

So, over the next few posts, I'll try to create a process of some-sort, using bits of code from here and there, run it through NodeJS and cram it into MongoDB, the end result of which will be my solution:)
